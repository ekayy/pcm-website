                <p>
                  Broken pipes and toilet overflows can quickly damage properties within a matter of minutes. A fire sprinkler head can disperse 30 to 50 gallons of water per minute, and broken pipes have the potential to exert even more. Within the time that it takes to shut off your water system or for the fire department to arrive, damage can extend to multiple floors and subsystems in your property.

                <p>
                  Each year fires cause $8.6 billion in direct property loss. According to FEMA, fires can engulf a property within a period of five minutes. Heat and smoke from fire can be more dangerous than the flames themselves. Secondary damages such as smoke and soot can cause costly repairs as well.

                <p>
                  There are a multitude of possibilites in how a building can become damaged by vehicles or other means. Some of the common damages may consist of compromising the structural integrity of the building, marring of cosmetic features, and damaging of windows and doors, fencing, block walls, broken pipes and any other structural elements.

                  When the Northridge earthquake occurred in 1994, Har-Bro had an office located near the epicenter that allowed us to access and work around the clock for our priority clients. After an earthquake, the structure of your building is going to be compromised and immediate shoring and bracing will be important.
